# coding-test


I have one controller in my html to perform what need to be done.

I use ng-repeat to perform the employee names and i add two functions to achieve the goal which is:  

"By default, bio content is hidden.  

-By clicking on the employee name, it expands/collapses the items's bio content.  

-Only one item can be expanded at a time (expanding one will collapse the others)  

-Additionally by clicking on the content, an action occurs(can be an alert with item data)."  


Also i write a single unit test to test the controller, to be more specific i test if the "employee name" to be null.  


`##how to run the unit test`

install karma and jasmine globe, and simply put "karma start" in you terminal.
